/**
 * Preferences: editor state that is NOT part of a saved config.
 * The port of `preferences/preferences.py` (131 lines).
 *
 * The three-way split the desktop draws (`preferences.py:1-14`) is the whole
 * point of the file, and it holds here unchanged:
 *
 *   ConfigData   per-particle behaviour. SAVED. Loading someone else's config
 *                should change these -- that IS the config.
 *   WorldData    global simulation properties (trail decay). Saved, for the
 *                same reason: they define how the piece looks.
 *   Preferences  how YOUR editor is set up: brightness, physics rate, canvas
 *                size. NOT saved with a config, because loading a config you
 *                downloaded should not dim your screen or resize your canvas.
 *
 * ## Storage: localStorage, not a file
 *
 * The desktop writes `preferences.json` at the repo root. There is no
 * filesystem here, and the plan (Step 7) names `localStorage` as the
 * replacement. The two differences that follow are both deliberate:
 *
 *   - **Storage may be absent or throw.** Safari in private mode throws from
 *     `localStorage.setItem`, and an embedded context may have no `localStorage`
 *     at all. `load()` NEVER THROWS (the Python's contract) and `save()`
 *     swallows the failure with a console warning, the way the Python swallows
 *     `OSError`. An editor that cannot persist preferences must still run.
 *   - **`load()` is synchronous**, matching the Python, because
 *     `localStorage` is. Step 9's IndexedDB config storage will not be, but
 *     preferences are small and the synchronous API is what keeps startup from
 *     needing an await before the first frame.
 *
 * Unknown keys are DROPPED on load, so a downgrade survives a newer version's
 * file -- `preferences.py:112-113` filters against the known field set for
 * exactly that reason. Keys of the wrong TYPE are dropped too, which the Python
 * does not do: `json.loads` there feeds a dataclass that never validates, so a
 * hand-edited `"physics_steps": "lots"` would reach the GPU as a string. In
 * JavaScript that lands as `NaN` in a uniform and freezes the simulation, so
 * the port validates at the boundary. See `coerce`.

 * vector is added to the CANVAS SAMPLE the sensors read -- so there was no
 * previous behaviour to match and nothing to derive the scale from.
 *
 * An estimate from the deposit formula put this near 1.0, on the reasoning that
 * the brush lays down ~0.5 per frame at default power while descaled canvas
 * values sit in the low single digits, so the two are already commensurate.
 * **That estimate was three orders of magnitude too hot in practice**, because it
 * accounted for the magnitudes and not for the fact that a painted trail is
 * PERMANENT while a simulated one decays every step -- so a stroke that merely
 * matches the canvas instantaneously ends up dominating what the sensors see
 * within a second. The working value came from drawing with it.
 *
 * Kept as a named constant, and separate from `WALLS_FIELD_GAIN`: the two feed
 * different shader paths, and a retune of one must not silently move the other.
 * `DEFAULT_FIELD_STRENGTHS` mirrors this number in `particleSystem/uniforms.ts`
 * (which may not import this module) and `preferences.test.ts` asserts the two
 * agree -- that test is what caught this value changing without its mirror.
