/**
 * Mutation Scale, as a wide slider centred above the canvas.
 *
 * ## Why this is not a Tweakpane control
 *
 * Mutation Scale is the single most consequential control in the app -- it was
 * the FIRST entry in the registry for exactly that reason, and being first in a
 * folder in a 320px column is still buried. What it wants is width and a
 * position that reads as primary, and Tweakpane has neither to give: its
 * layout is a fixed label/widget split inside a docked pane, which is the right
 * shape for forty settings and the wrong one for the setting.
 *
 * So this is plain DOM, following the precedent `menuBar.ts` and `dialogs.ts`
 * already set for UI that has outgrown the pane. It lives OUTSIDE both panel
 * containers, is owned by `Panel`, and is hidden along with everything else by
 * `X`.
 *
 * **It is not a second source of truth.** The registry entry still exists
 * (`panel: false`), and the label, bounds and help text are read from it rather
 * than restated here -- so the overlay and the config can never disagree about
 * what the range is. The value round-trips through the command bus exactly as a
 * Tweakpane slider's does.
 *
 * ## The drag guard is this file's `refreshing`
 *
 * `refresh()` runs every frame and writes the authoritative value into the
 * slider. A native `<input type=range>` under the mouse would fight that write:
 * the thumb would snap back to last frame's value mid-drag, every frame. The
 * `dragging` flag is the same idea as the panel's `refreshing` guard, in the
 * other direction -- the panel guards against a refresh being read as a user
 * edit; this guards against a refresh CLOBBERING one.

    // desktop size, and every one of them has to GROW rather than shrink to be
    // usable with a finger -- so it splits by what the controls are FOR:
    //
    //   TOP     Mutation Scale and the gear. The slider is the most
    //           consequential control in the app and the one that most wants
    //           width, so it gets a row where it can take all of it. The gear
    //           rides along because it is a fixed-width icon that would waste a
    //           row of its own.
    //   BOTTOM  everything that is pressed rather than dragged -- the layout
    //           presets, the rerolls, Reset and the tool selector.
    //
    // **THE LABEL SITS ABOVE THE SLIDER, NOT BESIDE IT**, which is the whole
    // reason it can be here at all. Beside it -- the desktop arrangement -- it
    // costs ~110px of a 390px row, and the slider is the control that most wants
    // that width. Above it costs one line of vertical space in a bar that has
    // more of that to give.
    //
    // An unlabelled slider was the wrong trade. It is the single most
    // consequential control in the app, and on touch it had NOTHING naming it:
    // the desktop's fallback is the tooltip, which here needs a deliberate long
    // press to reach, so a user who does not already know what the slider does
    // has no way to find out by looking.
    //
    // The READOUT comes back with it, on the same line, right-aligned. It is the
    // one thing a slider position genuinely cannot tell you -- the actual number
    // -- and sharing the label's line means it costs no extra height.
    //

    // Pause/Resume, TOUCH ONLY, at the left end of the top row.

    // basic transport act, and on touch it was reachable only by opening the
    // panels and finding the Transport checkbox, several taps deep.
    //
    // IT SITS BESIDE THE SLIDER because the two are the controls you reach for
    // WHILE WATCHING -- freeze the picture, then adjust it -- and this row is
    // already the row for those. The bottom row is one-shot actions that restart
    // or reroll, which is a different kind of press.

   * This gate existed once, was removed, and is back on a narrower claim. The
   * removal argued that rerolling at zero and then raising the slider is a real
   * gesture, so gating it made that order unreachable. True as far as it goes --
   * but it weighs an ordering some users might use against a button that, when
   * pressed, does nothing observable. Pressing it still moves the seed and still
   * marks the document dirty (`project.ts` counts a seed move as a change), so
   * the un-gated version spends real state on a no-op and gives no hint why the
   * picture held still. The order the removal protected still works: raise the
   * slider, then reroll. So the gate returns, with a title naming the slider
   * that lifts it -- which is what the earlier version lacked.
   *
   * `scale` is null when the field is missing from `editConfig`; that degrades
   * to "live", since a button that works is the safer failure here.

   * Colour the population group: gold means "this is what is running".

   *
   * A layout preset writes BOTH a cohort count and `initialConditions: GRID`
   * (`setPopulationLayout`), so it is only truthful to light one when both still
   * hold. Testing the count alone would light the 16 button for a config with 16
   * cohorts scattered at random -- a state that button has never produced and
   * would not produce if pressed.
   *
   * At most one is ever lit, because the counts are distinct. None is lit
   * whenever the layout is not Grid, which is the honest answer: no preset
   * describes that state.
   *
   * ## Fences is coloured on its own terms
   *
   * Gold when the fences are ON, independent of which preset is active, because
   * that is what its own toggle says. It also swaps from a DASHED ring to a
   * SOLID one -- the colour says "active" the same way the presets do, and the
   * line style says which of the two states it is in without relying on colour
   * alone.
   *
   * **Read from `editConfig`, which survives a closed panel.**
   * `settingsSources` keeps every config field but `rule` in that payload
   * precisely so the always-visible bar can read it (`asRecord(config,
   * ['rule'])`). Adding `Status` fields for these two would duplicate values
   * already crossing the boundary.

/**
 * What the touch layout's context button does right now.
 *
 * =============================================================================
 * ONE BUTTON, BECAUSE ONE GESTURE IS MISSING
 * =============================================================================
 *
 * The desktop reaches four different acts through the RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON, and a
 * touchscreen has no such button. `hintFor` already knows which of them is live
 * in a given state -- it decides whether to offer the red Cancel button or the
 * red Undo button -- so this reads the same states and names the act, rather
 * than inventing a second opinion about them.
 *
 * PURE AND MODULE-LEVEL, for the reason `hintFor` above is: the mapping from
 * state to action is the whole of the feature and it should be assertable
 * without a DOM.
 *
 * ## The three actions, and why Shove and Draw differ from Select
 *
 *   CANCEL   a cohort is lit. Right-click cancels the aim on the desktop, so
 *            this does. The gold commit button beside it is the other half.
 *   UNDO     Select with nothing lit -- the desktop's plain right-click undo.
 *   TOGGLE   Shove and Draw. These two tools use BOTH mouse buttons for real
 *            work (push/pull, draw/erase) rather than for backing out, so
 *            there is nothing to cancel and no undo to reach; what a finger
 *            lacks here is the second button itself. The context control
 *            becomes a latch that says which button a drag imitates.
 *
 * **THE TOGGLE IS DELIBERATELY NOT REACHABLE BY LONG PRESS.** `touchBinding`
 * polls for long presses in Select only, and `touchGestures` refuses one on a
 * dragging finger -- two independent guards for the same hazard, which is that
 * resting mid-stroke is normal and flipping draw into erase underneath a stroke
 * in progress would erase what was just drawn. The button is the only route.

// `pointer-events` is the load-bearing part. The root spans the full width so

// trap across the whole top of the canvas -- so the ROOT ignores the pointer
// and only the bar takes it back. Without this, a drag started near the top of
// the canvas would hit nothing.
//
// ## The geometry, and the two bugs it fixes
//
// **`top` clears the menu bar.** The bar is fixed at `top:0` and runs about
// 26px tall (`menuBar.ts`); at `top:8px` this overlay ran straight through it.
//
// **THE `top` HERE IS ONLY THE STARTING VALUE.** `reposition` overwrites it
// from the first frame onward, and `overlayTop` decides what it becomes: the
// clearance only when the two bars actually overlap horizontally, and 8px when
// they do not. What this declaration is for is the frame before the first
// measurement -- it starts in the arm that cannot overlap the menu bar, so a
// bar that is never measured is merely lower than it needs to be rather than
// sitting on top of File and Share.
//
// MENU_BAR_CLEARANCE POSITIONS THIS OVERLAY ONLY. `panel.ts` does not import it
// -- its `PANEL_TOP_PX` is a hand-computed literal that has to clear the menu
// bar AND this bar's full height, and the two are related by intent rather than
// by code. So they CAN drift, and changing either alone is how they overlap.
// (A previous version of this comment claimed the opposite; it was never true.)
//
// **`transform`, not flex, does the centring.** With `left:0;right:0` and
// `align-items:center` the bar was centred in whatever width the root happened
// to have -- and `position:fixed` resolves that against the viewport, which
// changes when a scrollbar appears or disappears as the panels are toggled with
// `X`. The bar visibly jumped. Anchoring the LEFT EDGE at 50% and pulling back
// by half the bar's own width centres it against a fixed reference instead, so
// nothing about the panels can move it.
// **THE CLEARANCE IS NOW A FALLBACK, NOT THE POSITION.** It is what the bar
// uses before it has been measured (a hidden or not-yet-laid-out element
// measures as a zero rect) and whenever the menu bar cannot be found at all.
// `overlayTop` is what decides the real number, per frame -- see it for why the
// static value was costing vertical space in the common case.
const MENU_BAR_CLEARANCE = 34;

// **BOTH OF THESE ARE DELIBERATELY TINY**, and they were 8px each when this
// rule was first written. 8px is the ordinary spacing constant in this file and
// it is the wrong one here: the whole point of measuring the collision is to
// stop spending vertical space that buys nothing, and a margin large enough to
// read as a deliberate gap is that same waste in a smaller denomination. 2px is
// enough to keep the two borders from appearing to merge into one thick rule,
// which is the only thing separation has to achieve here.

 * How far down the mutation bar has to start, given who is beside it.
 *
 * ## Why this is measured rather than a constant
 *
 * The bar used to sit at a fixed `MENU_BAR_CLEARANCE`, which cleared the menu
 * bar unconditionally -- and the menu bar is a strip at the TOP LEFT that is
 * only as wide as its six titles, while this bar is CENTRED. On any window wide
 * enough for both, they do not overlap horizontally at all, so the clearance was
 * buying nothing and spending ~26px of the picture to buy it. That cost is worst
 * exactly where it hurts most: the two rows here are already the tallest chrome
 * on screen.
 *
 * So the rule is the one a human would apply by eye. If the two rectangles
 * OVERLAP HORIZONTALLY, drop below the menu bar. If they do not, go to the top.
 *
 * ## Why the test is horizontal only
 *
 * Both elements are `position:fixed` near `top:0`, so they are always at the
 * same height -- vertical overlap is a given and testing for it would make the
 * condition self-referential (the bar is only clear of the menu bar BECAUSE this
 * function moved it, so a two-axis test would flip back and forth every frame).
 * Horizontal separation is decided by widths this function does not control,
 * which is what makes it a stable input.
 *
 * ## Degrading
 *
 * `menu` is null when the menu bar is absent, and a zero-width rect (`left ===
 * right`) is what an unlaid-out or hidden element measures as. Both fall back to
 * the static clearance rather than to the top: overlapping the menu bar is the
 * failure that makes controls unclickable, and this is the arm that cannot cause
 * it.

//
// So this is `position:relative` with the caption absolutely positioned into the

// a trap worth naming: `flex` governs the MAIN axis, and the main axis changed.
//
// The slider was a direct child of a flex ROW, where `flex:1` meant "take the
// free WIDTH". Adding the caption above it put it inside a flex COLUMN, where
// the same `flex:1` means "take the free HEIGHT" -- so it started sharing the
// column's height with the caption and collapsed from 44px to 16px.

// That is a tap-target failure that LOOKS FINE: the control renders normally and
// drags correctly with a mouse. It was caught by measuring the element, not by

//
// `width:100%` now carries the horizontal fill, and `flex:none` with a
// `min-height` floor keeps the target size out of the column's distribution.
// **SYMMETRY IS WHAT KEEPS THE KNOB ON ITS TRACK; THE HEIGHT IS FREE.** An

// tall once the caption had claimed its own line above.
//
// 32px MATCHES THE STEPPER ARROWS, which is the same judgement made there: a

// a mis-aimed selection without tapping a particle again -- and tapping a
// particle precisely is exactly what a fingertip is bad at. Dropping it would
// mean the one recovery path from a bad aim is the gesture that produced it.
//
// What buys the width instead is the LABEL. "Currently selected cohort:" is
// ~180px of a 390px row saying something the lit cohort already shows; the
// compact `‹ 3 ›` says it in 110px and stays operable.

// the desktop's 16px.

// shares the hint row with the gold and red buttons, and at 36px arrows plus a
// 3em field it took enough width to crush both to 63px and clip their labels.

// two 44px buttons, they wrap rather than stopping at either end, and the cost
// of a mis-tap is one step of a cycle. That is a materially different risk from

// falling back to a white sheet under pale text. The hint is stated as well, for
