/**
 * The settings registry: every entry names a real field on its real source.
 *
 * ## The failure this exists to catch
 *
 * A `Setting` is a data table entry, so `field` is a plain string and **the
 * compiler cannot check it**. An entry naming a field that does not exist
 * produces a control that renders, moves, and does nothing at all -- and it
 * does nothing SILENTLY, because `editSelected` and `withValue` both return the
 * receiver unchanged for an unknown field (which is the right behaviour, and
 * exactly what makes the failure quiet).
 *
 * Renaming a config field is the realistic way to reach it: nothing in the type
 * system connects `SimulationConfig.sensorGain` to the string `'sensorGain'` in
 * this table. So this test is the connection, for all 35 entries at once.
 *
 * ## And the enum lockstep
 *
 * `DROPDOWN_MODES`' ORDER IS THE ENUM: each label's index is the value stored
 * and uploaded to the GPU. Reordering a tuple there silently changes what every
 * saved config means -- a config that said Wrap now says Bounce, and the
 * simulation just behaves differently. Asserted against `BC` and `IC`
 * themselves rather than against a transcription.
