/**
 * The hotkey table.
 *
 * The port of `ui.py:422-491` (`_dispatch_hotkeys`) -- but a TABLE rather than
 * that function's straight-line `if` chain, because the port plan asks Step 8
 * for "a focus-aware rebindable table" and only data can be rebound. Dispatch
 * reads the table; nothing about dispatch knows which key does what.
 *
 * =============================================================================
 * THIS TABLE IS DELIBERATELY CTRL-FREE, AND DIVERGES FROM THE DESKTOP
 * =============================================================================
 *
 * The plan (Step 8, "Hotkey collisions -- deferred by decision") lists four
 * desktop bindings that collide with things the browser already owns, and
 * defers the choice to whoever builds the table. **The choice made was to move
 * every collider to a bare key** rather than to intercept a browser
 * combination:
 *
 *   | Key       | Command               | Desktop was |
 *   |-----------|-----------------------|-------------|
 *   | `C`       | setCheckpoint         | Ctrl+C      |
 *   | `V`       | loadLatestCheckpoint  | Ctrl+V      |
 *   | `M`       | toggleCameraMode      | Tab         |
 *   | `Z`       | undo                  | Ctrl+Z      |
 *   | `Shift+Z` | redo                  | Ctrl+Shift+Z / Ctrl+Y |
 *
 * The consequence, and the reason it is worth the divergence: **no app hotkey
 * ever calls `preventDefault` on a Ctrl combination**, so the browser keeps
 * Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V, Ctrl+R and Ctrl+Z entirely and unconditionally. The failure
 * the plan warns about -- "`preventDefault` then breaks copying text out of
 * Tweakpane fields" -- cannot occur, because there is nothing to prevent.
 *
 * Two bindings are intentionally ABSENT rather than moved:
 *
 *   - **Ctrl+R (revert to saved)** is not bound at all. It needs Step 9's
 *     storage to have anything to revert TO, and the browser reloads the page.
 *   - **Tab** is left to DOM focus traversal. The plan calls this collision
 *     "worse than with imgui, since Tweakpane is real focusable DOM" -- and
 *     that cuts the other way too: keyboard traversal of a real panel is worth
 *     more than a second binding for a command that now has `M`.
 *
 * Everything that did NOT collide keeps its desktop key exactly: `1`/`2`/`3`
 * tool, `X` hide UI, `Space` pause, `R` reset, `B` behaviour, `F` seed,
 * arrows for presets, `Home` reset camera.
 *
 * One binding is WEB-ONLY: `H` / `?` opens the guide. The desktop has no
 * equivalent because it has no Help menu to mirror.
 *
 * ## What is not here: WASD and Q/E
 *
 * Continuous motion is not a hotkey. It reads `keysHeld` against `dt` in
 * `orchestrator.applyCameraKeys`, and routing it through this table would make
 * it one step per key-REPEAT, whose rate is an OS setting (`ui.py:477-479`).

  // rule was the all-zero sentinel, which made `F` a second key for `B` in a
  // state the user could not see -- while the Reroll button and menu row that

  //
  // **THE MOUSE MIRRORS THIS PAIR AND IS NOT IN THIS TABLE.** Right-click undoes
  // and Shift+Right-click redoes, decided in `applyCanvasInput` -- the canvas
  // reads the buttons directly and is not rebindable, so those gestures cannot
  // be expressed here. The shift convention is deliberately the same, which is
  // why this note lives beside the rows it copies rather than only there.

  // --- the config clipboard. MOVED off Ctrl+C/Ctrl+V -----------------------
  // These are the app's OWN checkpoint stack, never the OS clipboard -- the
  // desktop comment at `ui.py:436-439` is emphatic that Ctrl+C/V were chosen
  // as "the familiar keys for the familiar idea", which is precisely the reason
  // they cannot keep them here: on the web there IS another clipboard.
  //
  // `shift: false` IS LOAD-BEARING, exactly as it is on the `Z` pair above. An
  // omitted `shift` means "don't care" (`matchHotkey`), so without it this row
  // would claim Shift+C as well and the share link below would never fire.
  //
  // That failure used to be INVISIBLE, because setting a checkpoint showed
  // nothing on screen -- it would have looked like the clipboard silently
  // failed. It now raises a "Checkpoint set: <name>" toast, so the wrong one
  // firing would at least be legible; the guard stays because a toast naming a
  // checkpoint is still the wrong answer to a request for a share link.

  // share link's paste, and an omitted `shift` would claim both.
  { code: 'KeyV', shift: false, command: { kind: 'loadLatestCheckpoint' } },

  // --- the cohort stepper --------------------------------------------------
  //
  // **THE ARROWS NO LONGER CYCLE PRESETS.** They did, and it was the wrong home
  // for them: LEFT/RIGHT next to a lit cohort reads as "move along the cohorts",
  // and loading an entirely different preset is a far larger act than an arrow
  // key should perform -- it replaces every particle's behaviour, and doing that
  // by a stray keypress is how someone loses the state they were watching.
  // Presets remain on the Simulation menu, which is where a deliberate act
  // belongs.
  //
  // **NO CONDITION IS EXPRESSED HERE, and none is needed.** These fire always;
  // `setHighlightedCohort` is documented to REFUSE when no cohort is lit (and
  // when highlighting is off at all), so the keys are inert in exactly the state
  // the specification calls for. Encoding "only when highlighted" in this table
  // would be a second copy of that rule, and the two would drift.
  //
  // The `cohort` values are deltas ONLY because the Orchestrator wraps them:
  // `wrapCohort` resolves them against the live count, so -1 from cohort 0 lands
  // on the last cohort rather than off the end. Same command the `‹`/`›` buttons
  // on the hint bar send, so the two routes cannot disagree.
  { code: 'ArrowRight', command: { kind: 'stepHighlightedCohort', delta: 1 } },

  // Enter COMMITS what the arrows aimed. Together the three make selection
  // reachable without the mouse at all: an arrow lights cohort 0, the arrows
  // walk to the one you want, Enter adopts it.
  //
  // Refused by the Orchestrator outside Select mode and with nothing lit, for
  // the same reason the arrows are -- the condition lives with the state it
  // reads rather than being restated here.
  //
  // **`Enter`, NOT `NumpadEnter` as well.** `matchHotkey` compares `code`, and
  // the numpad key reports its own; adding it is one more row here whenever
  // someone asks. Left out for now rather than guessed at, since a keypad Enter
  // landing on a text field is the more likely thing a user is doing with it.

  // --- tools ---------------------------------------------------------------
  // Zipped against MOUSE_MODES, whose "MEMBER ORDER IS THE TOOLBAR ORDER and
  // the 1/2/3/4 key order" (`commands.ts:67`). Built rather than written out so
  // adding a tool needs one array member and nothing here -- the desktop zips
  // for the same reason (`ui.py:466-469`). The Trails tool arrived on `4` this
  // way, with no edit to this file.

  { code: 'KeyX', local: 'toggleUi' },
  // `local`, not a `Command`, for the reason `toggleUi` is: the clipboard is
  // the browser's and the Orchestrator has no DOM in it at all. It hands over a
  // document when asked (`CommandBus.projectDocument`) and never learns that a
  // clipboard exists. Rule 10 cuts both ways.
  //
  // Shift+C rather than a bare key because plain C is the checkpoint, and the
  // two are close enough in spirit -- "keep this" -- that pairing them under
  // one physical key is a mnemonic rather than a collision.
  //
  // Shift+C / Shift+V then inherit the SHAPE of the pair below them: C and V
  // are copy and restore for the in-session checkpoint stack, and shifted they
  // are copy and restore for the clipboard. The same gesture, one step further
  // out -- which is a mnemonic worth more than either key on its own.

  // P for picture, and the shifted pair follows the SAME RULE as C and V above:
  // bare is the ordinary thing, shifted is the sharing thing. `P` is a plain
  // screenshot; `Shift+P` is a screenshot that carries the project with it.
  //
  // THE BARE KEY IS THE UNSHIFTED ONE ON PURPOSE. A picture of what is on screen
  // is the commoner want by far -- people screenshot to show something, not to
  // hand over a project -- so the cheaper gesture goes to the cheaper action,
  // matching how C and V put the in-session operation on the bare key.

  // The two reference documents, on the two keys everyone tries. `local` for
  // the same reason as the rest of this block: the overlay is the panel's, and
  // the Orchestrator has no DOM in it.
  //
  // **ONE KEY EACH, not two keys onto one document.** `H` is help-the-prose and
  // `?` is help-the-keys, matching the split the overlay itself makes -- so
  // someone after the key list gets it in one press rather than a scroll.
  //
  // `Slash` with `shift: undefined`, so it matches `/` as well as `?`. The two
  // are one physical key on a US layout and `code` cannot tell them apart
  // anyway; demanding Shift would leave `/` doing nothing, and `/` is not bound
  // to anything else to collide with. `keyLabel` translates the row to `?` via
  // `KEY_SYMBOLS`, since the bare `code` is the literal word "Slash".
