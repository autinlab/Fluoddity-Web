/**
 * The save dialog and the two confirmations: delete a config, reset preferences.
 *
 * Native `<dialog showModal()>`, which gives Escape-to-cancel, focus trapping
 * and an inert backdrop for free -- all three of which the desktop's imgui modal
 * has to arrange by hand (`config_menu.py:377-410` wires Escape explicitly).
 *
 * ## Two error channels, and they mean different things
 *
 * `config_menu.py:453-462` is emphatic about this and it ports unchanged:
 *
 *   - **local validation** -- the UI DECLINING TO DISPATCH at all ("Enter a
 *     filename."). The Orchestrator never hears about it, because nothing was
 *     ever asked of it.
 *   - **`status.saveError`** -- the Orchestrator reporting an ATTEMPTED save
 *     that failed (a name that sanitizes to nothing, storage denied).
 *
 * The second is read from status **every frame**, never once after dispatch.
 * That is not defensive coding: storage is genuinely async here, so reading it
 * on the line after `send` would read the previous frame's value and close the
 * dialog on a save that had not landed yet.
 *
 * ## The dialogs live outside the panel container
 *
 * `setHidden` toggles the panel's `display`, and a modal that has taken input
 * must not vanish with it -- that would leave the app apparently frozen with no
 * way to answer the question. The desktop keeps its dialogs outside the
 * `gui_hidden` check for the same reason (`ui.py:274-289`).
