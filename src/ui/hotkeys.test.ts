/**
 * The hotkey table: no ambiguity, no dead bindings, and the focus gate.
 *
 * WHY THIS TEST EXISTS. A table is data, and data rots differently from code.
 * Two rows can quietly come to claim the same keystroke, at which point which
 * one wins is decided by array order -- a property nobody intended to be
 * semantic. A row can name a command that no longer exists, which the compiler
 * catches, or a key that no longer reaches it, which it does not.
 *
 * The focus gate gets its own group because it is the single thing standing
 * between a user typing a preset name and the `r` resetting their simulation.
