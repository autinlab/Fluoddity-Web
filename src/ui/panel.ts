/**
 * The panel: two docked side-panels built from sections, plus the overlay.
 *
 * The port of `ui.py`'s `_build_ui` (`:274-297`) and the five window mixins it
 * calls. **Replaces `ui/thinPanel.ts`**, which was Step 7's flat registry dump.
 *
 * ## Two panels, split by what the state IS
 *
 * The desktop has five independent floating windows because they grew that way,
 * and `ARCHITECTURE.md`'s "Toolbar and the planned side-panel" names the
 * endpoint it wants instead: a docked panel whose visible controls follow the
 * active tool, with "each `_*_window()` body as a panel-*section* function".
 *
 * That endpoint arrived as TWO panels rather than one, because the controls
 * divide on something more fundamental than the tool: Project is the config you
 * save and share, and everything else is how your editor is set up. See
 * `panelModel.ts` for the split, and `sections/settingsSection.ts` for where
 * the tool-selection part of the endpoint actually landed -- as a tab that
 * follows the tool, driven from `refresh` below.
 *
 * **One `Panel` still owns both.** The tooltip, the gate state, the dialogs,
 * the menu bar and -- critically -- the `refreshing` flag are all panel-wide.
 * Two `Panel` instances would give two of each, and two `refreshing` flags is
 * two chances to get the guard below wrong.
 *
 * ## THE RETAINED-MODE FEEDBACK LOOP, and the flag that closes it
 *
 * **Tweakpane is retained-mode: writing a proxy and calling `pane.refresh()`
 * makes it fire `change` on every binding whose value moved -- and it cannot
 * distinguish a value the USER dragged from one the APP just pushed in.**
 * Without the `refreshing` guard, loading a preset feeds that preset's own
 * values straight back through `editSetting`, so a single `Next >` recorded
 * FOUR history entries (measured: depth 1 -> 5) and the top of the undo stack
 * read "edit Sensor Distance". Undo then stepped back through those phantom
 * edits instead of unloading the preset, which looks exactly like "undo is
 * broken" and is not.
 *
 * The desktop has no equivalent hazard: imgui is immediate-mode, so a widget
 * reports a change only when the user actually moves it. This is a real
 * difference between the two UI models, not a Tweakpane quirk, and **every
 * retained binding in every section needs the guard.**
 *
 * Verified in the bundle, because the fix depends on it: `pane.refresh()` ->
 * `BindingApi.refresh()` -> `fetch()` -> the plain `rawValue` setter, which
 * calls `setRawValue(v, {forceEmit: false, last: true})`. So a programmatic
 * refresh is indistinguishable from a released drag by `ev.last` alone -- which
 * is exactly why 10d's gated latch must test this flag FIRST and `ev.last`
 * second.

   * ## THE IMAGE IS THE PROJECT
   *
   * The point of the feature: post the picture anywhere that carries pictures,
   * and anyone who can save it can load what made it. No link to keep beside it
   * and nothing for a chat client to truncate -- which is the failure
   * `shareLink.ts` warns about at 8000 characters and cannot otherwise prevent.
   *
   * ## THE ORDER OF OPERATIONS IS FORCED
   *
   * The payload has to exist BEFORE the crop overlay opens, because the stamp's
   * size -- and therefore the minimum selectable region -- depends on how long
   * the link is, which depends on how many configs the project holds. So the
   * document is serialized first, the minimum is computed from it, and only then
   * does the user get to drag. Doing it the other way round would mean telling
   * someone their perfectly good selection was too small AFTER they made it.
   *
   * ## CAPTURE HAPPENS AFTER THE OVERLAY IS GONE
   *
   * `pickCropRegion` resolves once it has removed its own elements, and the
   * capture reads the canvas underneath. If the overlay were still mounted the
   * read would be unaffected -- it is a separate element, not a canvas filter --
   * but the dimming would be on screen while the browser encoded, which reads as
   * a freeze. Sequencing it after is free and looks deliberate.

   * ~20 REAL frames per probe. Without a reset the first thing someone sees on

   * of `runCalibration`) driving live frames with nothing reset after them. So
   * the ladder's reset is immediately undone by the phase that follows it. This
   * is the last point where the whole run is known to be over.
   *
   * **NOT IN `tuneRate` OR `finishRateCalibration`**, deliberately: those are
   * shared with the Auto-calibrate Physics Rate button, which measures the piece
   * the user is looking at and must leave it running. Resetting there would wipe
   * live work to measure it. This method is only ever reached with the splash
   * up -- first run, and Reset Editor Preferences -- where there is nothing on
   * screen worth preserving because the user has not seen it yet.
   *
   * IN `finally`, so a calibration that threw or was cut short still hands over
   * a fresh simulation rather than a half-probed one.
