/**
 * The settings registry: one declaration per control.
 * A direct port of `ui/settings_spec.py` (35 entries, 447 lines).
 *
 * ## The point of this file
 *
 * Every tunable in the app is declared here once, with its tier, bounds, source
 * and help text. The settings panel renders whatever this list says. **Adding a
 * control is a one-line entry, not a UI edit** -- that is the abstraction the
 * desktop's tiering was asked for, and it is what makes Step 10's real UI a
 * rendering change rather than a rewiring.
 *
 * ## Tiers
 *
 *   BASIC     shown always. The handful of knobs that most change the result.
 *   ADVANCED  shown only when the user asks for the full set.
 *
 * The split exists because an undifferentiated wall of sliders was
 * intimidating. Basic is deliberately short.
 *
 * ## Sources -- three places a value lives, with different save semantics
 *
 *   CONFIG   per-particle, in the ConfigBuffer. SAVED with the config.
 *   WORLD    global simulation state. Saved with the config.
 *   PREFS    editor state. NOT saved -- loading someone's config must not
 *            change your brightness or canvas size.
 *
 * ## Kinds
 *
 *   SLIDER     drag to change; applies live.
 *   INPUT      type a value, commits on Enter. For DISRUPTIVE settings that
 *              reallocate GPU resources and reset the simulation.
 *   INT        integer slider.
 *   BOOL       checkbox. Usually the head of a `revealsOn` group.
 *   SEED       a Randomize button with the current value shown beside it.
 *   CHOICE     dropdown over `options`.
 *   GATED      a slider that shows a checkbox while it sits at `gateBase`.
 *              GATED_INT is the integer form. **Step 10 implements the gating**
 *              (`ui/gated_controls.py`); Step 7's thin UI renders these as
 *              plain sliders, which is the correct degradation -- nothing about
 *              a gate is stored, so the value behaves identically either way.
 *
 * ## What Step 7 uses and what it does not
 *
 * The thin UI reads `kind`, `lo`, `hi`, `options`, `label` and `source`. It
 * ignores `group`, `tier`, `revealsOn`, `gates`, `curve` and `inverted` -- all
 * of which are Step 10's, and all of which are carried here verbatim so that
 * step is a UI change with no registry archaeology. `help` is carried for the
 * same reason; Step 7 hangs it off the control's `title` attribute, which is
 * free and better than dropping it.
 *
 * `curve` and `inverted` are the two that would be TEMPTING to drop, and must
 * not be: they change what the stored value is for a given slider position, so
 * a Step 10 that re-derived them would have to re-derive them CORRECTLY or
 * every affected config silently changes meaning.
