/**
 * One registry entry -> one Tweakpane control.
 *
 * The port of `settings_window.py`'s `_render_setting` / `_draw_widget` pair
 * (`:218-346`), which is the desktop's single dispatch point from a `Setting` to
 * a widget. Keeping it single matters for the same reason there: adding a
 * control is a registry entry, and the only place that has to understand a new
 * `kind` is this file.
 *
 * ## The proxy, and why every control needs one
 *
 * **Tweakpane binds to a mutable property**, and the app's state is immutable
 * and lives behind the command bus. So each control gets a one-property object
 * that Tweakpane writes into, and an `on('change')` that turns the write into a
 * command. `refresh()` then pushes the authoritative value back in, which is
 * what makes undo, preset loads and randomize show up in the panel without the
 * panel knowing any of them happened.
 *
 * The alternative -- binding straight to a mutable settings object -- would make
 * the panel a second source of truth, and the first divergence would be silent.
 *
 * ## `data-setting`, and why it is not decoration
 *
 * Every control's blade element carries `data-setting="${source}.${field}"`.
 * Tweakpane's own class names are minified (`cn('sld')` and friends), so without
 * a stable hook every CDP selector in `tools/uiCheck.mjs` would be a guess
 * against a build artifact -- and would break on a dependency bump rather than
 * on a real regression. One attribute at build time makes every later check an
 * exact query. It is also what lets a test assert blade IDENTITY across a
 * visibility toggle, which is how "this did not rebuild" is verified.
