/**
 * The v8 save format: reader, writer, and filename sanitizer.
 *
 * A port of `particle_system/persistence.py` (373 lines), minus everything v7.
 *
 * PURE. No fetch, no IndexedDB, no DOM -- it turns a parsed JSON document into a
 * `SavedConfig` and back. That is what makes the whole format testable under
 * `node --test`, and it is why the storage layers above (`manifest.ts`,
 * `idb.ts`, `configStore.ts`) hold no knowledge of the format at all: there is
 * exactly one interpreter of these bytes, whether they came off the network or
 * out of a database.
 *
 * ## v7 IS ABSENT BY CONSTRUCTION, not by an early return
 *
 * `persistence.py:213-282` carries a `LEGACY COMPATIBILITY` block and a
 * `_from_v7` reader, and its own docstring (`:216-219`) says they "must not
 * appear in the WebGPU port: the spec that port follows is the v8 format
 * alone." So there is no `version <= 7` arm here -- not even one that throws a
 * friendlier message, because that would be a v7 code path with a v7's worth of
 * assumptions about what those files contain. A version that is not 8 is
 * unrecognized, full stop.
 *
 * ## The tolerances are not optional
 *
 * Every `??` below reproduces one from the Python, and each has its line cited.
 * They exist because fields were ADDED to v8 after it shipped, so a file written
 * before a given field simply lacks it -- and every one of them fails SILENTLY
 * when dropped. The worst is `mutationSeed`: a missing fallback loads seed 0.0,
 * which the chaotic hash turns into a completely different rule. That is a wrong
 * adopted rule, which looks like a legitimate result.
 *
 * All eight files currently in `configs/` carry every optional block, so none of
 * these fallbacks is exercised by shipped data today. They guard files a user
 * still has locally, and they cost nothing.
