/**
 * The URL options a link can carry: which splash to open, what to call the
 * project, and which editor preferences to propose.
 *
 * PURE, in the way `shareLink.ts` is pure -- it takes a query string rather
 * than reading `window.location`, so every case here runs under `node --test`
 * with no browser. `main.ts` is the only place that supplies a real one.
 *
 * ## These values are UNTRUSTED
 *
 * Everything here arrives in a URL someone else can write. That is the whole
 * reason the settings half exists as a PROPOSAL rather than an application:
 * `preferences.ts` already refuses to let a loaded config change your
 * brightness or canvas size, and a query parameter must not be the back door
 * that does what a config file is forbidden to do. So this module's job is to
 * parse and CLAMP; deciding is the dialog's, and applying is the caller's.
 *
 * Two consequences worth stating, because both are easy to undo by accident:
 *
 *   - **Out-of-range values are dropped, not clamped into range.** A link
 *     asking for `worldSize=99` is not a request for the maximum, it is a
 *     malformed request, and silently rewriting it to 4.0 would show the user
 *     a checkbox they never would have agreed to. `settingsSpec.ts` owns the
 *     bounds and is read here rather than restated.
 *   - **`name` is TEXT, never markup.** It is rendered wherever the project
 *     name is rendered, so it is length-capped here and inserted with
 *     `textContent` at the far end.
 *
 * ## Why the settings are a separate type from the rest
 *
 * `?splash` and `?name` take effect unconditionally -- they change what you
 * look at, not how the editor is configured, and neither survives a reload or
 * touches `localStorage`. The five settings DO persist once applied, which is
 * what makes them worth asking about. Keeping them in their own record is what
 * lets `main.ts` apply the first two immediately and hold the third until the
 * user has answered.
