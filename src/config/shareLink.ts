/**
 * The share link: a whole v8 document packed into a URL fragment.
 *
 * PURE, exactly as `persistence.ts` is pure -- no DOM, no fetch, no `window`.
 * `buildShareUrl` takes the pieces of a location rather than reading one, which
 * is what lets every case below run under `node --test` with no browser.
 *
 * ## A FOURTH TRANSPORT, NOT A FOURTH FORMAT
 *
 * `persistence.ts` says there is "exactly one interpreter of these bytes,
 * whether they came off the network or out of a database". A link is the third
 * place bytes can come from, and it changes nothing about that claim: this file
 * chooses a TRANSPORT, `shareCodec.ts` chooses a REPRESENTATION, and
 * `fromDocument` remains the only thing that decides what a document MEANS. So a
 * link made by a future version fails in `fromDocument` with its version
 * message, not here with a vaguer one -- and `decodeShareLink` deliberately
 * returns `unknown` to keep it that way.
 *
 * ## TWO PAYLOAD FORMATS, ONE OF THEM WRITE-ONLY
 *
 * `#b=` is base64url over `shareCodec.ts`'s bytes and is what every link written
 * from now on carries. `#c=` is JSON through lz-string, is still READ, and is
 * never written -- links in chat histories and bookmarks outlive a refactor, and
 * the keyed fragment was designed for exactly this (see `SHARE_HASH_KEY`).
 *
 * The binary form is roughly a THIRD the length: ~530 characters for the
 * one-config project that took ~1800 before. `shareCodec.ts`'s header explains
 * where that comes from and why no compressor is stacked on top of it.
 *
 * ## WHY THE FRAGMENT AND NOT THE QUERY
 *
 * A fragment is never sent to the server. This app is a static deploy with no
 * backend to store anything, so the entire project has to ride in the URL, and
 * putting a couple of kilobytes of it in the query string would put it in every
 * access log and referrer header for nothing in return.
 *
 * ## TWO TRAPS THAT DICTATE THE CODE BELOW
 *
 * Both were confirmed by experiment against lz-string 1.5.0 and the real
 * `configs/`, and both fail SILENTLY, which is why each has a test of its own.
 *
 * 1. **`URLSearchParams` CORRUPTS THE PAYLOAD.** `compressToEncodedURIComponent`
 *    emits an alphabet that includes `+`, and `URLSearchParams` decodes `+` as a
 *    space -- so a payload routed through it comes back UNEQUAL to the input.
 *    The app parses its query string with that class (`main.ts:79`), so reaching
 *    for it here is the natural move and it is wrong. The fragment is parsed by
 *    `startsWith`/`slice` below, and must stay that way.
 *
 *    For the same reason the payload is NOT wrapped in `encodeURIComponent` on
 *    the way out: the compressor's alphabet is already URI-component-safe by
 *    construction -- that is the entire difference between it and plain
 *    `compress` -- and double-encoding would break the round trip.
 *
 *    THE BINARY PAYLOAD INHERITS THIS, which is why it is base64URL rather than
 *    base64: standard base64's `+` is the very character above, and `/` and `=`
 *    are two more that do not belong in a fragment unescaped. See
 *    `bytesToBase64Url`.
 *
 * 2. **A TRUNCATED PAYLOAD RETURNS `''`, IT DOES NOT THROW.** Decompressing half
 *    a payload yields an empty string rather than raising. Truncation is the
 *    single likeliest thing to happen to a long link in the wild -- chat clients
 *    that linkify only part of it, mail clients that hard-wrap -- so a bare
 *    `try`/`catch` would let the commonest real failure through as a silent
 *    no-op. The empty result is checked for explicitly.

// ## THE IMPORT IS AWKWARD ON PURPOSE
//
// lz-string 1.5.0 is CommonJS (`main: libs/lz-string.js`, no `exports` field)
// and its `.d.ts` declares NAMED exports the package cannot actually provide
// through Node's ESM loader. Three forms were tried, and the first two are the
// obvious ones:
//
//   - `import { compressToEncodedURIComponent } from 'lz-string'` type-checks
//     and then throws "does not provide an export named" under `node --test`.
//   - `import LZString from 'lz-string'` works at runtime but is a type error
//     here: `verbatimModuleSyntax` is on and `esModuleInterop` is not.
//   - `import * as LZString` resolves, but Node puts the functions on
//     `.default` -- the namespace's own keys are literally `default` and
//     `module.exports`, so reading them off the namespace gets `undefined`.
//
// Vite's interop resolves all three in the browser, which is what makes this
// worth a comment rather than a shrug: the tempting form is GREEN IN THE APP
// AND RED IN THE TESTS, and the failure is a `TypeError` at the moment someone
// tries to share a link rather than anything the compiler will point at.
//
// So the namespace is unwrapped once, tolerating both shapes, and every use
// below goes through the two consts.
