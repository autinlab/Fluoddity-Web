/**
 * A `RuleDeriver` backed by a real WebGPU device.
 *
 * ## WHY THIS IS THE ONLY CORRECT IMPLEMENTATION
 *
 * `reconstruct.ts` needs `derive_entity_rule` to rebuild a cohort selection, and
 * `rule.wgsl`'s header sets out at length why that function must not be
 * reimplemented in another language: `pow(h, 2.0)` versus `h*h` differs by 1 ULP
 * and the chaotic hash amplifies it into a completely different rule; the
 * generator leans on a fused multiply-add the GPU performs and a host generally
 * will not. The desktop kept such a mirror in `mutation.py`, the web port
 * deleted it, and the failure mode is a rule that looks entirely legitimate and
 * is wrong.
 *
 * So this runs THE ACTUAL SHADER on a device, through the same `rule.wgsl` the
 * simulation and the picker call. A rule it returns is bit-identical to the one
 * the user adopted, because it is computed by the same code on the same kind of
 * hardware.
 *
 * ## THE CONFIG IS PACKED BY `pack.ts`
 *
 * Not hand-assembled here. `writeConfigRecord` is what fills the ConfigBuffer
 * the simulation reads, so reusing it means the bytes the deriver hands the GPU
 * are the bytes the GPU would have had -- including the int lanes written
 * through an `Int32Array` view, which a hand-rolled packer is exactly the place
 * to get subtly wrong.
 *
 * Only three fields actually matter to `derive_entity_rule` (`rule`,
 * `mutationSeed`, `mutationScale`), but a full record is packed anyway: a
 * partial one would depend on the shader continuing to ignore the rest, which is
 * not a property anything guarantees.
 *
 * ## LIFETIME
 *
 * `createGpuDeriver` builds the pipeline and buffers ONCE and returns a deriver
 * that reuses them. Reconstructing a thousand selections is a thousand small
 * dispatches, not a thousand pipeline compiles.
 *
 * The returned deriver is ASYNCHRONOUS, because a readback is. `reconstruct`
 * takes a synchronous `RuleDeriver`, so the intended pattern is `deriveAll` --
 * pre-derive every selection in one pass, then hand `reconstruct` a synchronous
 * lookup over the results. That is also the efficient shape: one submission per
 * rule rather than one per reconstruction attempt.
