/**
 * Assembler: the finished camera frame, turned into what the screen shows.
 * A port of `assembler/assembler.py`.
 *
 * The Camera hands over a linear HDR frame -- possibly the average of several
 * temporal samples -- and this module takes it the rest of the way:
 *
 *     bloom        wide glow around bright regions, added in linear space
 *     brightness   exposure, still linear
 *     tone curve   asinh, linear -> display
 *     overlays     strafe field, brush reticle
 *
 * THE ORDER IS THE POINT. Light is added and exposed while the values still
 * mean energy, and the curve runs once at the end; the original Fluoddity
 * tonemaps before blooming and pays for it by inverse-tonemapping in two
 * separate shaders to get back to a space where addition is meaningful.
 *
 * Everything but bloom happens in one pass (`shaders/frameAssembly.wgsl`),
 * because each stage is a handful of instructions on a value already in a
 * register -- splitting them into separate passes would cost a full-screen read
 * and write each to save nothing.
 *
 * Holds no simulation state and no preferences: the caller passes what this
 * needs per frame, including the already-resolved decisions about whether the
 * overlays should be visible at all.
 *
 * ## The dummy textures
 *
 * `assembler.py:102-109` relies on "intensity 0 means the sampler is never
 * fetched, so a stale binding is harmless." WebGPU validates a bind group
 * whether or not the shader reads it, so both optional slots carry a real 1x1
 * texture when their feature is off. The zero in the uniform is still what
 * guarantees they are never sampled for real -- the dummy is a validation
 * formality, not a fallback anyone should see.
