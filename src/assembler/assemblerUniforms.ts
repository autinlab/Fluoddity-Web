/**
 * Packing the assembler's uniform buffers.
 *
 * Same conventions as `camera/cameraUniforms.ts` -- read that file's header for
 * why these structs do not embed `WorldData`, and `particleSystem/uniforms.ts`
 * for the int-in-a-float-lane idiom.
 *
 * ## THE SWITCHES LIVE IN THE VALUES
 *
 * `assembler.py:102-109` and `:123-132` push the on/off decision INTO the
 * numbers: bloom off writes `bloom_intensity = 0.0`, and the shader's
 * `if (bloom_intensity > 0.0)` then skips the fetch entirely, so a stale
 * sampler binding is harmless. Same for `field_opacity` and `reticle_radius`.
 *
 * The desktop's motivation was that a stale GL sampler costs nothing when it is
 * never fetched. The port has a stronger one: WebGPU validates a bind group
 * whether or not the shader reads it, so those slots carry a 1x1 dummy texture
 * (see `assembler.ts`) and the zero is what guarantees the dummy is never
 * sampled for real. It is also what keeps `fwidth` legal in
 * `frameAssembly.wgsl` -- the derivative calls sit inside branches on these
 * uniforms, so control flow at them is uniform. Do not move these decisions
 * into the shader.
