    // as you move an unrelated slider. It also stays out of the bloom, which
    // reads its own texture: a background that glowed would be a background that
    // grew a halo around the frame's edge.
    //
    // ## BEFORE THE OVERLAYS, because they sit on top of everything visible
    //
    // The field overlay and the reticle `mix()` toward white. Compositing after
    // them would tint the reticle by the background and make the ring hard to
    // see against a coloured one -- it is a UI element, not part of the picture.
    //
    // ## SCREEN, NOT ADD
    //
    // `add` and `screen` agree to within a rounding step for the dark colours
    // this is actually for, and diverge where it matters: a mid-grey background
    // plus a bright particle ADDS past 1 and clips to white, losing all
    // structure in exactly the regions worth looking at. Screen compresses
    // instead, so a lighter background degrades gracefully rather than
    // flattening. Where the image is black it returns the background exactly,
    // and where the background is black it returns the image exactly.
    //
    // ## THE ZERO GUARD IS NOT AN OPTIMIZATION
    //
    // At black, `1 - (1-0)*(1-c)` is algebraically `c` but NOT bit-identical to
    // it: `1.0 - (1.0 - 0.1)` is 0.09999999999999998. Every render made before
    // this feature existed would shift by one ULP in every channel, which is
    // invisible and would still break the pixel-exact screenshot comparisons the
    // browser tools make. The guard is what keeps the default path untouched.
    //
    // Applied to the WHOLE FRAME, letterbox bars included. The bars are black
    // today and so is the empty world, so tinting both keeps them one surface;
    // colouring only the interior would draw a rectangle nobody asked for.
