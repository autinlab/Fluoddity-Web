/**
 * Structural checks on the assembler shaders.
 *
 * The two that earn their keep here are the `asinh` formula and the `fwidth`
 * uniformity guard. A bare `asinh(` would simply fail to compile, so that is
 * not the risk -- the risk is the SIGN-LOSING variant, which compiles fine and
 * is correct for every input this shader currently sees. And the `fwidth`
 * guard is a refactor hazard: the fix that breaks it (hoisting `inside` into
 * the outer condition) looks like a tidy-up.
 *
 * See `camera/shaders/shaders.test.ts` for why these run against the expanded
 * source and strip comments first.
