/**
 * Entry point.
 *
 * The desktop analogue is `main.py` (4 lines) plus `Orchestrator.run()`
 * (`orchestrator.py:256-365`). **Step 7 moved the frame loop out of here** and
 * into `orchestrator/orchestrator.ts`, which is where it belongs: this file now
 * acquires a device, builds the Orchestrator and the panel, and turns
 * `requestAnimationFrame` into calls on them.
 *
 * What that leaves here is the three things that are genuinely the entry
 * point's: device acquisition and the unavailable/lost paths, the `?debug`
 * readout, and the startup URL overrides.
 *
 * ## What is still missing, and which step owns it
 *
 * Nothing is missing now: Step 10 finished, and `ui/panel.ts` is the real
 * interface. Step 7's flat registry dump (`ui/thinPanel.ts`) was deleted with
 * the `?ui=thin` escape hatch that kept it reachable through Step 10's
 * sub-steps.

  // that the URL describes the state the tab ARRIVED in rather than its live
  // state, which is what a fragment normally means anyway, and `Shift+C`
  // regenerates a correct one on demand.

  // think of as "open a file". Nothing in the app writes the hash and there are

  // the panel having to know a verification tool exists.

  // first showing for the same reason `?nopanel` exists: `browserCheck.mjs`
  // compares screenshots, and a full-frame overlay would change what those
  // compare. Help > Welcome still opens it either way.

  // up on every single load, which is right exactly once and an obstacle every
  // time after -- a full-frame overlay between someone and the app they came

  // the same signal that gates calibration, so the two arrive together: a first
  // visit gets the welcome copy WITH the progress line under it, and every
  // visit after starts straight in the app. Help > Welcome is how you get it
  // back, and Help > Controls/Guide (or `H`) is where the details went.

  // means something to someone who has seen what 1 looks like on their machine.
  // Two things have to happen first:
  //
  //   1. **Calibration, on a first visit.** The ladder WRITES `worldSize` and
  //      `physicsSteps` (`commitCalibration`), so asking beforehand would offer
  //      to change a value that is about to be overwritten, and the answer would
  //      be silently undone moments later. Waiting also means the comparison is
  //      against the machine's real measured settings.
  //   2. **The splash, whenever one is up.** A modal stacked over the welcome
  //      would be two overlays deep on someone's first second in the app.
  //
  // Both resolve to the same signal: the splash closing. On a first visit the

    // the previous frame to the file. Doing that for as long as the pause lasts
    // is exactly the "dead space in the middle of the video" this must not
    // produce.
    //
    // Because the frame COUNTER only advances on frames that are actually
    // encoded, the finished clip holds precisely `duration * fps` frames of real
    // motion however many times the user paused along the way. The physics frame
    // count is invariant under pausing, which is what makes the pause safe to
    // use as an inspection tool mid-export.
