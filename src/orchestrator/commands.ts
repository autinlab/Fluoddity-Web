/**
 * The command and status API: the UI/simulation boundary, made typed.
 *
 * ## What this file is for
 *
 * `ARCHITECTURE.md` invariant 10 says `ui/` imports no simulation module, and on
 * the desktop that is enforced rather than aspirational: `toolbar.py` mirrors
 * `MouseMode` by string VALUE, and `ui.py:384` duck-types to avoid importing
 * `PickResult`. The price is that the boundary is two untyped dicts -- a
 * 29-entry command table (`orchestrator.py:206-244`) and a 30-key status dict
 * (`STATUS_KEYS`, `:518-539`), both keyed by bare strings.
 *
 * **The plan names typing them "the port's job" (Step 7), and this is it.** The
 * boundary stays exactly as narrow as it was; what changes is that a typo is
 * now a compile error instead of a `KeyError` at the moment a menu is opened.
 *
 * ## Why a discriminated union rather than an interface of methods
 *
 * A method-per-command interface would be the idiomatic TypeScript, and it is
 * the wrong shape here for one specific reason: the desktop's UI *holds* the
 * command table and dispatches by name, which is what lets `toolbar.py` build
 * itself from a list without knowing what any button does. A union preserves
 * that -- a UI can construct a `Command` value, pass it around, log it, or defer
 * it -- while the `switch` in `orchestrator.ts` gets exhaustiveness checking
 * that the Python's dict lookup never had.
 *
 * It also makes the ARGUMENTS typed, which the dict never did: `set_mouse_mode`
 * took a string OR a `MouseMode` (`selection_commands.py:162`) precisely because
 * nothing could check it.
 *
 * ## The status contract, and the guarantee that makes it usable
 *
 * `_report_status()` supplies EVERY key, every frame, before the UI builds a
 * single panel -- which is why desktop UI code indexes `self._status['key']`
 * rather than defending itself with `.get(key, fallback)`. A missing key means
 * the Orchestrator forgot one, which is a bug worth hearing about, not something
 * to paper over with a default that silently renders as '-' forever
 * (`orchestrator.py:508-517`; three keys once carried DIFFERENT defaults at
 * different call sites).
 *
 * `Status` below is a total interface with no optional members, so TypeScript
 * enforces that guarantee at the one place the object is built. That is
 * strictly stronger than the tuple of key names it replaces.

 *   SHOVE   drag pushes particles away from the cursor, right-drag pulls in.
 *   DRAW    drag paints the strafe field, right-drag erases.
 *
 * SHOVE and DRAW are easy to confuse and worth stating apart: Shove acts on the
 * PARTICLES, directly and only while the button is held. Draw paints the FIELD,
 * which then keeps pushing whatever crosses it until it is erased.
 *

   *
   * This is an EVENT, and `Status` is otherwise a snapshot of levels. A level

 * ## What Step 10 DID change here, and why
 *
 * This interface did not change. Two `Command` payloads did, and both were
 * type-narrowing rather than new capability -- no handler gained work, and
 * nothing crossed the boundary that was not already crossing it:
 *
 *   - **`editDrawPref.field`: `string` -> `DrawPrefField`.** It was the one
 *     payload the compiler could not check, which is the failure this file's
 *     header says the boundary exists to eliminate.
 *   - **The three preview commands gained a `surface` token.** One shared
 *     snapshot slot cannot serve two simultaneous hover-browsers; see
 *     `PreviewSurface` for the bug that makes concrete.
 *
 * The alternative to the second was the UI holding two `Project` snapshots
 * itself, which would put simulation state in `ui/` -- a far worse breach of
 * invariant 10 than a token that is a pair of string literals.

   *     keystroke -- would undo that for nothing.
   *   - **Not a `Command`.** A command that copied to the clipboard would put

   * turns it into a URL and writes the clipboard. The Orchestrator hands over a
   * document and never learns that a clipboard exists.
