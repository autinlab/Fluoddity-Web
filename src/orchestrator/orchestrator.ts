/**
 * Orchestrator: the sole broker of commands and data between modules.
 * The port of `orchestrator/orchestrator.py` and its six command mixins.
 *
 * Owns one instance each of Surface, Camera, Assembler and ParticleSystem, plus
 * the project, history and preferences. Modules hold no references to one
 * another; all inter-module communication flows through here. Two examples of
 * the pattern, both preserved verbatim from the desktop:
 *
 *   - Data: each frame the Orchestrator pulls the current canvas texture from
 *     ParticleSystem (via a narrow accessor) and hands it to Camera. Camera
 *     never holds a persistent reference to it.
 *   - Commands: the UI reports named intents which the Orchestrator translates
 *     into method calls on the right module.
 *
 * **THIS FILE HOLDS THE LOOP, THE WIRING AND THE STATE -- NOT THE HANDLERS.**
 * "Sole broker" means it routes, not that it implements.
 *
 * ## The mixins become composition, and what that changed
 *
 * The desktop has six command mixins (`ProjectCommands`, `ClipboardCommands`,
 * `SettingsCommands`, `SelectionCommands`, `DrawingCommands`, `ShoveCommands`)
 * flattened into one class by Python's MRO, and **the MRO is load-bearing**
 * (`orchestrator.py:106-107`): the mixins own no state, they read and replace
 * attributes defined on the Orchestrator, and they call each other's methods
 * freely. TypeScript has no multiple inheritance, and the plan asks for the
 * cross-calls to become explicit dependencies.
 *
 * So each group is now a MODULE OF FUNCTIONS taking the collaborators it needs
 * (`projectCommands.ts`, `clipboardCommands.ts`, `settingsCommands.ts`), and
 * this class is what holds the state they read and replace. The seams the
 * desktop's section comments marked are the same seams; only the mechanism
 * differs.
 *
 * **What that mechanically prevents:** on the desktop, `ShoveCommands` reaching
 * `self.prefs` is invisible in its signature, so nothing stops a mixin growing
 * a dependency on state it has no business seeing. Here every dependency is an
 * argument, and adding one is visible in the diff.
 *
 * ## Frame order
 *
 * Input is polled at the TOP of the frame, so the physics and rendering that
 * follow act on this frame's input rather than the previous frame's. See
 * `frame()`, which states the two ordering constraints Step 6 established and
 * this step must not break.

   *
   *  1. The pending selection resolves FIRST, before input can dispatch a new
   *     pick -- there is one result slot, so a new dispatch clobbers the answer
   *     being read.
   *  2. BOTH HALVES OF PICKING SIT OUTSIDE THE PAUSED BRANCH: the resolve at the
   *     top, and `recordPick` below it. `runFrame` is what a paused frame skips,
   *     and clicking to select must keep working when it is. Only the resolve
   *     was hoisted originally, which left paused picking recording nothing and
   *     reading stale bytes -- the two have to move together.
   *  3. Input is applied ABOVE the render, because painting (Step 9) binds its
   *     own target and would otherwise paint over the screen.
   *  4. `recordPick` runs AFTER the branch, so the pick sees the positions the
   *     frame ended on rather than the ones it started from.
   *  5. The assembler presents AFTER the sub-step loop, because the camera
   *     binds its own targets for every sample inside it.

    // the capture canvas -- reading only the crop box's interior.
    //
    // ## The crop, and why this is now EXACT
    //
    // The recording size is capped at the window size, and the recorded pixels
    // are the interior of a centred box of exactly that size. So every exported
    // pixel is a real rendered pixel taken 1:1 -- there is no upscaling, no
    // second render of the world, and no resolution the source cannot supply.
    // (This replaces an earlier design that offered sizes ABOVE the window and
    // stretched to reach them, which was correctly composed but no sharper than
    // the window it came from.)
    //
    // `capture` carries that as a uv remap. `windowSize` stays the WINDOW's,
    // not the crop's: the letterbox maths must place the world exactly as it is
    // placed on screen, and the remap is what selects the sub-rectangle
    // afterwards. Passing the crop size here instead would re-letterbox the
    // world for a smaller viewport and the recording would show a different
    // framing than the box promised.
    //
    // A SECOND `present()` RATHER THAN A COPY OF THE FIRST. The two differ in
    // ways a blit could not express: this one reads a sub-rect, carries no
    // brush reticle and no crop box, and the screen must keep showing both.
    //
    // IT IS CHEAP, and that is the point of the design rather than an accident
    // of it: `camera.result()` is the already-accumulated HDR frame, so
    // everything expensive -- every physics sub-step, every blur sample --
    // happened once, above, and is shared. This pass is bloom plus a tone curve
    // over a texture that already exists.
    //
    // WHY THE OVERLAYS ARE HAND-BUILT rather than `this.overlayState()`:
    //
    //   - The RETICLE is dropped. It is a cursor, not part of the picture, and
    //     a video with a ring following an absent mouse is not what anyone is
    //     exporting.
    //   - The CROP BOX is dropped, for a stronger version of the same reason: it
    //     marks what will be recorded, so recording it would burn the annotation
    //     into the thing it describes.
    //   - The FIELD is KEPT, when it would be on screen. Unlike those two it is
    //     painted content -- the user made it, it steers the particles, and
    //     `fieldAlwaysShow` is an explicit statement about wanting to see it.
    //     Suppressing it would silently drop authored work from the export.
    //
    // Bloom and motion blur need no mention: blur is baked into
    // `camera.result()` before the assembler sees it, and bloom runs INSIDE
    // `present()` from `this.prefs`. Both are in the recording because both are
    // in the frame, which is what "record what the camera outputs" means.

   * **THE POINT IS THAT IT DOES NOT SAVE.** `adoptPreferences` writes to
   * `localStorage` on every change, and a ladder that walked seven rungs
   * through it would leave whichever rung it happened to abort on as the
   * user's stored setting -- including a rung that FAILED. Calibration commits
   * exactly once, at the end, through the normal path; everything before that
   * is a measurement, not a decision.
   *
   * Rebuilds through `rebuildSystem` rather than reimplementing it, so probes
   * inherit its guarantees: the replacement is built before the old one is
   * dropped, the live project carries over, and the outgoing GPU resources are
   * destroyed rather than leaked. Seven rungs would otherwise leak up to seven
   * entity buffers.
   *
   * Only rebuilds when the world size actually moves. Physics rate is live --
   * `frame()` re-reads it every frame -- so half the rungs cost nothing but an
   * assignment.
   *
   * **RETURNS WHETHER IT REBUILT**, and the ladder needs to know. A rebuild
   * constructs a fresh `ParticleSystem` whose `_frameCount` starts at zero, and
   * zero is the reset sentinel every shader watches for (`reset()` at
   * `particleSystem.ts:800`): the next frames regenerate every entity's
   * position, velocity and rule, and clear the canvas. Those frames are far
   * more expensive than the steady state, so a rung measured across them reads
   * as unaffordable when it is not. A physics-only change keeps the same system
   * and its accumulated frame count, so it needs no such burn-in -- which is
   * the difference this return value carries.

  /**
   * Run and submit one physics frame, resolving when the GPU has finished it.
   *
   * **WHY NOT JUST TIME `frame()`.** Two reasons, either one fatal.
   *
   * The first is the pause. Calibration runs behind the welcome splash, and the
   * splash pauses the simulation -- a paused `frame()` takes the branch that
   * skips `runFrame` entirely and renders one still image. Timing that would
   * measure the camera, not the physics, and would report the same number for
   * every rung on the ladder.
   *
   * The second is that `performance.now()` around `frame()` measures nothing
   * useful even unpaused. WebGPU submission is asynchronous: `submit` queues a
   * command buffer and returns, so the wall time around it is CPU-side encoding
   * cost, which barely moves as the GPU load changes. That is fine for the
   * debug overlay's readout, which is all it was ever for, and useless as a
   * calibration signal. `onSubmittedWorkDone` is what actually waits for the
   * GPU.
   *
   * SO THIS IS A DELIBERATELY MINIMAL FRAME: physics only, no camera, no
   * assembler, no pick. That narrows what is being measured to the thing the
   * two knobs actually scale, and it is why `HEADROOM` exists to account for
   * everything left out.

   *
   * **THE RESET LEAVES THE LADDER'S OWN WORK BEHIND**, and it is no longer the

   * covers the splash paths, this covers any caller of `commitCalibration`.
