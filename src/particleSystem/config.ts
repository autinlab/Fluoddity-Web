/**
 * Simulation configuration: the typed presets that drive the simulation.
 * A direct port of `particle_system/config.py`'s value types.
 *
 * Two distinct things live here, and the split is deliberate:
 *
 *   - `SimulationConfig` -> packs into the WGSL `ConfigData` struct, which
 *     lives in the ConfigBuffer storage buffer. These are PER-PARTICLE-
 *     POPULATION settings: each entity picks one via its own config_index.
 *     Behavior (the Fourier `Rule`) and physics parameters are unified here,
 *     because they are the same kind of thing and separating them is what made
 *     the reference sprawl.
 *
 *   - `WorldSettings`/`WorldConfig` -> pack into the WGSL `WorldData` struct.
 *     These are settings that would be meaningless to vary between two
 *     particles sharing a canvas: trail decay, world scale.
 *
 * This module holds the types, the defaults, the mode enums and the lane
 * ORDERING. Turning any of it into bytes is `pack.ts`'s job -- which is why
 * this file imports nothing but the lane assertion. Keeping it dependency-free
 * is what lets later steps' UI and persistence code import config types without
 * dragging the layout descriptor along.
 *
 * ## Field naming, and a note for the persistence step
 *
 * Python's `snake_case` becomes `camelCase` here (`sensor_gain` ->
 * `sensorGain`). This is the one place the port deliberately breaks its
 * one-to-one correspondence with the Python.
 *
 * Whoever ports `persistence.py` will need an explicit name mapping at the file
 * boundary -- and note that the saved format uses a THIRD set of names again
 * (`sensor.gain`, `force.global_mult`, `misc.lateral`), so a mapping is needed
 * regardless of this rename. It is not extra work caused by camelCasing.
