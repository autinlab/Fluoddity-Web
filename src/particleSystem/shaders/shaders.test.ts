/**
 * Structural checks on the Step 4 shaders.
 *
 * Nothing in this suite compiles WGSL -- that needs a real device, and headless
 * Chrome hands back a null adapter (see "Verification" in web/README.md). What
 * these tests cover is the class of mistake a compiler would NOT catch: a
 * binding number that drifted from the project-wide table, a workgroup size
 * that no longer matches the host's dispatch arithmetic, a GLSL preprocessor
 * line that survived translation, or the `textureDimensions` hoist quietly
 * coming undone.
 *
 * Each of those is silent. A wrong workgroup size under-dispatches and leaves a
 * tail of entities frozen; a lost hoist is a pure performance regression at
 * 600k x 30 invocations. Neither errors, and neither is visible in a
 * screenshot.
 *
 * The assertions run against the EXPANDED source -- the text `resolveIncludes`
 * produces, which is what the GPU is handed -- so an include that stopped
 * resolving would fail here too.
