/**
 * The simulation: entity buffer, trail canvas, and the three passes that
 * advance them. The port of `particle_system/particle_system.py` (472 lines).
 *
 * ## What `advance()` does, and why the order looks wrong
 *
 * Three passes per sub-step, and the order is NOT the obvious one:
 *
 *     update_entities    compute; reads the canvas, rewrites every entity
 *     update_canvas      decay + diffuse, front -> back, THEN SWAP
 *     splat_into_canvas  additive brush into the (new) front
 *
 * `particle_system.py:241-245` says it plainly: "The ordering here is a little
 * weird. It doesn't matter so much, but if I weren't trying to support legacy
 * configs, the proper order would be update_entities / splat_into_canvas /
 * update_canvas." It is ported as it IS, not as it should have been -- the
 * shipped presets were tuned against this order. Do not tidy it.
 *
 * Because the swap happens at the end of pass 2, the splat lands on the
 * freshly-decayed texture, and that same texture is what the camera reads.
 *
 * ## No memory barriers
 *
 * The Python calls `ctx.memory_barrier()` between passes. WebGPU has no
 * analogue and needs none: passes within a submission observe each other's
 * writes in order, and the implementation inserts the barriers. The ordering
 * guarantee the barriers provided is structural here.
 *
 * ## One encoder per frame
 *
 * At the default physics rate, `advance()` runs 30x per frame -- 90 GPU passes,
 * plus rendering. WebGPU's per-pass overhead is JS-side and higher than GL's,
 * which docs/WEB_PORT_PLAN.md:558-564 flags as the most likely place this port
 * becomes slower than the desktop. The plan's first-choice mitigation is
 * batching sub-steps into one encoder, so that is what this does from the
 * start: `runFrame()` opens ONE encoder, records every sub-step, and submits
 * once.
 *
 * That is also why `frameCount` rides a DYNAMIC OFFSET rather than being
 * rewritten per sub-step: `queue.writeBuffer` cannot be interleaved with an
 * encoder's passes, so all 30 sub-steps' uniforms are written up front into one
 * buffer and each pass binds its own slice.
