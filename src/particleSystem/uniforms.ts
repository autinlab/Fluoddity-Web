/**
 * Packing the per-pass uniform buffers.
 *
 * The desktop sets these as loose GLSL uniforms through moderngl's `tryset`,
 * one member at a time (`particle_system.py:180-182`, `:396-416`). WebGPU has
 * no such path: a uniform is a buffer, so each pass gets one struct and one
 * `writeBuffer`.
 *
 * ## Why this is not in `pack.ts`
 *
 * `pack.ts`'s header scopes it deliberately: it exists so `config.ts` can stay
 * dependency-free, and it is the only module that knows about *config* bytes.
 * Shader uniforms are a different concern, owned by the shaders' host module.
 * `packWorldConfig` is imported rather than reimplemented -- `WorldData` is
 * embedded verbatim at offset 0 of every struct below, so there is exactly one
 * piece of code that knows its layout.
 *
 * ## `uniform` address space vs `storage`
 *
 * WGSL's uniform address space has stricter alignment than storage: struct
 * members align to 16 and array strides must be a multiple of 16. That would
 * normally need an audit -- but the vec4-only rule (`common.wgsl:25-34`) means
 * every struct here is already built from `vec4f` alone, so uniform and storage
 * layouts agree by construction. This is the same argument the vec4 rule makes
 * for std430, applied one address space over. Nothing to check, but worth
 * writing down, because "uniform buffers lay out differently" is a real thing a
 * reader will worry about.
 *
 * ## Ints ride in float lanes
 *
 * `frameCount`, and the two booleans, are written through an `Int32Array` view
 * onto the same `ArrayBuffer` and read back with `bitcast<i32>` -- the idiom
 * `pack.ts:81-85` establishes and the same one `cfg_cohorts` and friends use.
 * A real `i32` member would also be legal here (the surrounding vec4s satisfy
 * its alignment), but it would be a SECOND packing convention for no gain.
 * One convention, used everywhere.

 * The density field takes its OWN vec4 rather than the two spare lanes in

 * would quietly promote that coincidence to a requirement -- after which a
 * change to either sizing rule would skew the other's world->uv mapping, which
 * is a stretched field rather than an error.
 *
 * `canvas_res` is THE `textureDimensions` HOIST. The GLSL calls
 * `textureSize(canvas_texture, 0)` at five sites per invocation
 * (`entity_update.glsl:151` twice via the two sensor taps, `:232` once or twice
 * via reset/fence, and `:384`); at 600k entities x 30 sub-steps that is not
 * free, and the value is constant for the whole pass anyway.
