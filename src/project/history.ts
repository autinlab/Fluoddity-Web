/**
 * Undo/redo over whole projects. A direct port of `project/history.py` (197).
 *
 * ## What is undoable
 *
 * Every deliberate act: slider edits, particle selection, seed randomization,
 * committed loads, preset cycling, checkpoint restores.
 *
 * TWO THINGS ARE DELIBERATELY EXCLUDED, and neither is an oversight:
 *
 *   HOVER-PREVIEW (and its restore). The load list applies a config as the
 *   cursor crosses each row, then puts it back when you move away. These are
 *   transient states the user never chose -- browsing forty configs would
 *   otherwise leave forty entries and evict real work. Only the COMMITTED load
 *   records. Coalescing cannot help: previews are not rapid edits to merge,
 *   they revert themselves.
 *
 *   UNDO AND REDO. They call the same `setProject` everything else does, so
 *   recording them would make undo push a history entry -- history about
 *   history.
 *
 * ## Coalescing
 *
 * A slider drag fires an edit per frame; without merging, two seconds of
 * dragging would be a hundred entries. Consecutive records sharing a
 * `coalesceKey` within `COALESCE_WINDOW_MS` collapse into one: the entry's
 * END state is updated in place while its start state stays put, so undo jumps
 * over the whole gesture.
 *
 * Keying on the field means moving to a different slider starts a new entry,
 * and pausing does too. Deliberate one-shot acts pass no key, so they never
 * merge -- randomizing the seed twice in a row is two undo steps, which is what
 * you want from a button.
 *
 * ## How it works
 *
 * Entries hold references to `Project`, which is immutable, so a snapshot costs
 * a pointer rather than a copy. `undo`/`redo` move a cursor rather than
 * destroying state, which is what makes redo nearly free.
 *
 * ## The one porting note
 *
 * `time.monotonic()` becomes `performance.now()`, which is milliseconds where
 * the Python is seconds. `COALESCE_WINDOW` is therefore stated in MILLISECONDS
 * here (1500, not 1.5). Getting that wrong does not error -- it makes every edit
 * coalesce forever, or none of them, and both read as "undo is behaving oddly"
 * rather than as a unit bug. `now` is injectable for exactly that reason: the
 * tests drive the window explicitly instead of sleeping.
 */

/**
 * Milliseconds within which same-key records merge. Long enough to bridge the
 * gaps in a slider drag, short enough that a deliberate second adjustment is
 * its own undo step.
 *
 * **MEASURED FROM THE LAST EDIT, NOT THE START OF THE DRAG.** `record` refreshes
 * `lastTime` on every merge, so a continuous drag coalesces for as long as it
 * lasts and this bound only decides how long a PAUSE may be before the gesture
 * is considered over.
 *
 * Raised from the Python's 0.5 s because nothing on the slider path calls
 * `breakCoalescing` -- Tweakpane's `ev.last` release is consumed by the gate
 * hold in `controls.ts` and never reaches history -- so a timeout is the ONLY
 * way a gesture ends. At 500 ms, hesitating on a value mid-drag to look at the
 * result, which is the normal way these sliders get used, split one adjustment
 * into several undo steps. 1.5 s covers that hesitation; a considered second
 * adjustment takes longer than this and still earns its own step.

 * returned void, so a caller could not tell a fresh act from the fortieth frame
 * of one drag -- both look like a call with a `before` and an `after`. The state
 * archive (`archive/`) hooks this path and files a node per act, and without
 * this it filed one per FRAME: two seconds of dragging one slider became a
 * hundred states, which is precisely the flood coalescing exists to prevent.
 * Undo was unaffected and looked correct throughout, which is what made it worth

 *
 * Framing it as "where am I on the timeline" rather than "what would undo
 * restore" is what keeps the two operations symmetric -- an earlier version had
 * the cursor trail the live state by one and needed different arithmetic in
 * each direction, which was a bug waiting to happen.

 * Because the live state is always IN the timeline, callers seed it once at
