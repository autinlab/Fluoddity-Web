/**
 * THE PANEL'S BROWSER VERIFICATION: the gated latch, and the reveal toggle.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT `npm test`. Every assertion here needs a real pointer gesture
 * against real Tweakpane DOM. `node --test` has no DOM at all, so the pure rules
 * (`gating.ts`, `reveal.ts`, `showsSlider`) are unit-tested there and the WIRING
 * -- which events open a session, which close it, and whether a visibility
 * change rebuilds the pane -- can only be checked here.
 *
 * WHY IT IS NOT `browserCheck.mjs`. That tool's only lever is the URL. It cannot
 * press a slider and hold it.
 *
 * ## What it checks
 *
 *   PASS 1  THE GATED LATCH. Press a gated slider, drag it to its base value,
 *           and assert it is STILL VISIBLE while the button is down -- then
 *           release and assert it folded back to a checkbox and the value landed
 *           on EXACTLY base.
 *
 *           This is the sub-step's entire risk. The value passes through the off
 *           zone during the gesture, so a latch that tested the value alone
 *           would fold the control away mid-drag and destroy the drag that
 *           produced it. A latch that tested `ev.last` without checking
 *           `isRefreshing()` first would fold it away on the next frame's
 *           `pane.refresh()` instead -- silently, and only sometimes.
 *
 *   PASS 2  THE REVEAL TOGGLE, and that it does NOT rebuild the pane. Ticking
 *           Gravity must reveal three sliders while every gated value is still
 *           zero, and must do it by flipping `blade.hidden` rather than by
 *           rebuilding -- so the assertion is that THE SAME DOM NODE is still
 *           there afterwards. A rebuild would drop folder expansion state and
 *           replace every node, and would look identical in a screenshot.
 *
 *   PASS 3  THE FOLD-BACK'S SNAP. A gated control dragged to within the off zone
 *           but not exactly onto base must store EXACTLY base, so that "is it
 *           off?" stays unambiguous rather than "within epsilon".
 *
 *   PASS 6  FOCUS RELEASE. Drag a slider, then press a hotkey and assert the app
 *           actually received it. Tweakpane focuses the slider TRACK on
 *           mousedown and keeps it after the drag, so the panel silently held
 *           the keyboard. Includes the guard that matters most: clicking into a
 *           writable number field must LEAVE focus there, or the fix for the
 *           above makes every number field untypable.
 *
 * ## Why `?bus`
 *
 * Two of these assert what was STORED, not what is drawn -- the fold-back's snap
 * is invisible on screen, since a control at 1e-9 and one at 0 both render as an
 * unticked checkbox. `?bus` exposes the command bus so the run can read status
 * back, the same lever `configCheck.mjs` uses.
 *
 * Usage (from the repo root, with `npm run dev` running):
 *   node tools/uiCheck.mjs
 *   node tools/uiCheck.mjs --port 5174

 * read-only readout tripped the editable-target gate) or fired ALONGSIDE
 * Tweakpane's own arrow stepping. `focusRelease.ts` fixes it, and only a real
 * browser can check it -- the decision is unit-tested in `focusRelease.test.ts`,
 * but the WIRING (delegated listener order against `addInput`'s own Enter
 * handler, the `closest` traversal, and what `document.activeElement` actually
 * ends up being) has no meaning without DOM.
 *
 * `togglePause` rather than `reset` as the end-to-end probe: both travel the
 * identical `window` keydown path in `inputBinding.ts`, but pause is readable
 * from status afterwards while a reset leaves no observable trace. The question
 * being asked is "did the keystroke reach the app", not "what did it do".

 *
 * The first version ended the gesture on a capturing `pointerup` at the window.
 * That looked like `recordingSection`'s `commitSteps` and was not the same
 * situation: a Tweakpane slider calls `setPointerCapture`, so the release is
 * retargeted to the blade and the capture-phase window listener sees it on the
 * way DOWN -- strictly before Tweakpane turns that same event into the final
 * `change`. The flag was cleared and then immediately re-armed by that last
 * `change`, so the ring stayed centred on screen indefinitely, until some
 * unrelated later click or keyup happened to clear it again.
 *
 * **THE ASSERTION THAT CATCHES IT IS "AFTER RELEASE, WITH NO FURTHER INPUT".**
 * Any check that clicked, typed or moved the mouse first would have passed
 * against the broken build -- that is precisely what made the bug survive: every
 * natural way of poking at it cleared the flag as a side effect.
 *
 * `overlayState()` is read directly rather than inferred from the screen. It is
 * private to TypeScript, which is a compile-time fiction; `?bus` hands out the
 * real Orchestrator and this is the state the shader is actually handed.
